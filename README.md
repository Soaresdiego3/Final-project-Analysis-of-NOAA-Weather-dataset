# Final-project-Analysis-of-NOAA-Weather-dataset

Assignment Scenario
Congratulations! You have just been hired by a US Weather forecast firm as a data scientist.

The company is considering the weather condition to help predict the possibility of precipitations, 
which involves using various local climatological variables, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, dew point, and pressure.
The data you will be handling was collected by a NOAA weather station located at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York.

Your task is to provide a high level analysis of weather data in JFK Airport.
Your stakeholders want to understand the current and historical record of precipitations based on different variables.
For now they are mainly interested in a macro-view of JFK Airport Weather, and how it relates to the possibility
to rain because it will affect flight delays and etc.

This project relates to the NOAA Weather Dataset - JFK Airport (New York). The original dataset contains 114,546 hourly observations of
12 local climatological variables (such as temperature and wind speed) collected at JFK airport. 
This dataset can be obtained for free from the IBM Developer Data Asset Exchange.

For this project, you will be using a subset dataset, which contains 5727 rows (about 5% or original rows) and 9 columns. 
The end goal will be to predict the precipitation using some of the available features. 
In this project, you will practice reading data files, preprocessing data, creating models, improving models and evaluating them to
ultimately choose the best model.
